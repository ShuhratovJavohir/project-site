          <b>Introduction</b>
          <br />
          <br />
          Networks and network-like structures, in which the transfer of charge, energy, signal and
          information occur in the quantum mode, appear in many branches of modern technology.
          Moreover, the coverage of various devices and technologies with such systems has been
          growing rapidly over the past few years due to the functionalization of quantum processes
          in nano-electronics, nano-mechanics, optoelectronics and quantum technologies. Therefore,
          understanding the fundamental processes occurring in such systems, managing their
          development scenario are of great importance for their functionalization and optimization
          of technologies with their participation. The solution of such a problem is impossible
          without the creation of realistic and physically acceptable models of quantum transport
          processes in network-like systems and their computer visualization. This problem is
          considered one of the most urgent in today's world science, and the direction itself is
          one of the most advanced. Therefore, such research contributes to a large extent to the
          penetration of advanced trends in domestic science, its integration into world science, as
          well as the growth of its competitiveness.

          <b>Purpose of the study</b>
          <br /><br />
          The main goal of this project is to study the transport of waves and quasiparticles in
          network-like structures that arise in quantum optics and optoelectronics, and apply the
          results of the study to the modeling and design of transparent and non-Hermitian
          (PT-symmetric) quantum networks, which allow signal transmission to be performed without
          loss or with minimal losses. The possibility of using such networks in quantum
          communications will also be explored. The project will consider quantum networks described
          by the Schrödinger equation on quantum graphs. The transparency of graph nodes will be
          ensured using the so-called transparent boundary conditions. Boundary conditions at the
          nodes of the quantum graph, which ensure the PT-symmetry of the graph will be derived. The
          quantum dynamics of quasiparticles in the presence of absorbing boundary conditions at the
          site and their possible equivalence to PT-symmetric boundary conditions will be studied.
          Models of transparent networks for application in optoelectronics, quantum optics and
          quantum communications will be the final result of the project.

          <b>Project objectives </b><br /><br />
          The main objectives of this project are the development of models that make it possible to
          study the controlled dynamics of quasiparticles in branched quantum structures that arise
          in optics, optoelectronics and nanophysics. Within the framework of the study, two types
          of quantum structures will be considered: Hermitian quantum structures and PT-symmetric
          quantum systems. The following specific tasks will be solved within the framework of the
          project:
